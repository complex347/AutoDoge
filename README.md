> Version: 0.12 (7/12/2016)
> 
> Written in Python 2.7.12 (Anaconda)
> 
> Description: Generate virtual screening report from large set of autodock4 docking results and extract best-binding conformations for best-binding or best-clustering cluster.
> 
> Operating systems: Windows / Linux
> 

### Update:
> Version 0.11: Argparser
>
> Version 0.12: Abandoned Argparser, implemented Tkinter GUI

### Note:
> This is a passion project that I have written in 2015-16, at that time I was still learning Python and programming in general, so in retrospect there are a lot of design flaws and beginner mistakes in the code. As a data-driven person, I would consider this to be easier to use than Scripps' Fox (http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/fox).
